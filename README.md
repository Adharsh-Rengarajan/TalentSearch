# TalentSearch
TalentSearch is a Java-based app powered by OpenAI that helps hiring managers find top candidates. Managers can log in, post jobs, and search by skills. Using LLMs, it analyzes job descriptions and matches them with ideal profiles, offering smarter, faster, and more accurate hiring than traditional keyword-based systems.
